# Active Suspension System

For my senior capstone project, my group chose to design an offroad trailer system. Since this was during COVID, we only had to design our project and not assemble any hardware â€” so my group decided to tackle a relatively large project. Our team consisted of 4 mechanical engineers (3 of whom focused on mechanical design, and I focused on controls), and 3 electrical engineers (who focused on the sensor implementation and power systems). 

### Problem Statement

In a search-and-rescue scenario in intensely offroad environments, patients must be transported and possibly operated upon over difficult terrain. Helicopter airlifts are often prohibitively expensive, both in operational costs and costs to the user (in the US around \$10k and \$40k respectively). However typical offroad suspension systems are inadequate for intensely rough terrain in mountainous or rocky environments.

### Our Solution

Our solution to this problem was a trailer which would be capable of being towed over very rough terrain by any common truck or Jeep. Additionally, since the injured patient could be in a critical condition, a bumpy ride could make injuries worse. For this reason we determined that the trailer must have some kind of active suspension system to minimize the acceleration felt by the passengers inside.
