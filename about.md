# About Me

Hello! I'm Jeremy (sometimes called Remy) and I'm a grad student at UCLA. I'm studying aerospace engineering with a concentration in control systems. I'm passionate about GNC, specifically for launch vehicles and spacecraft.

When I'm not doing engineering I spend most of my time rock cimbing, and spend as much time out in the mountains as possible.
