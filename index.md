# Jeremy's Website

**This website is still under construction, apologies in advance for any broken links!**

Hello! I'm Jeremy and I'm a grad student at UCLA. I'm studying Aerospace Engineering with a focus in control systems, and am an aspiring GNC engineer.

When I'm not doing engineering I spend most of my time rock cimbing, and spend lots of time in the mountains.

Please browse through and have a look at some personal projects I've worked on. Reach out if anything catches your eye!
