# Remy's Website

Hello! I'm Jeremy (sometimes called Remy) and I'm a grad student at UCLA. I'm studying Aerospace Engineering with a focus in control systems.

When I'm not doing engineering I spend most of my time rock cimbing, and spend lots of time in the mountains.

Please browse through and have a look at some cool extracurricular & personal projects I've worked on. Feel free to reach out if anything catches your eye!
